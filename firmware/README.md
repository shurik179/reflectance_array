* Firmware
Firmware is written in Arduino IDE, using [megaTinyCore](https://github.com/SpenceKonde/megaTinyCore) core. Choose attiny 1616 board, 10 Mhz. 

To upload it to the board, I used Adafruit's [UPDI fiend](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5879); I soldered pogo pins to it to connect with test points on the sensor.
